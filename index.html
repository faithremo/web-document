            <h3> Ovaries</h3>
            <P>The <a href="https://www.yourhormones.info/glands/ovaries/">ovaries</a>  are a pair of small glands about the size and shape of almonds,located on the left and right sides of the<br> pelvic body cavity lateral to the superior portion of the uterus. Ovaries produce female sex hormones such as estrogen<br>progesterone as well as ova (commonly called “eggs”), the female gametes. </P>
            <h3>Fallopian Tubes</h3>
            <p>The <a href="https://teachmeanatomy.info/pelvis/female-reproductive-tract/fallopian-tubes/">fallopian</a>  tubes are a pair of muscular tubes that extend from the left and right superior corners of the uterus to the<br> edge of the ovaries. The fallopian tubes end in a funnel-shaped structure called the infundibulum, which is covered with<br> small finger-like projections called fimbriae.</p>
            <h3>Uterus</h3>
            <p>The <a href="https://teachmeanatomy.info/pelvis/female-reproductive-tract/uterus/">uterus</a>  is a hollow, muscular, pear-shaped organ located posterior and superior to the urinary bladder. Connected to<br> the two fallopian tubes on its superior end and to the vagina (via the cervix) on its inferior end, the uterus is also known as<br> the womb, as it surrounds and supports the developing fetus during pregnancy. </p>
            <h3>Vagina</h3>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/inside-the-vagina" >vagina</a> is an elastic, muscular tube that connects the cervix of the uterus to the exterior of the body. It is located<br> inferior to the uterus and posterior to the urinary bladder. The vagina functions as the receptacle for the penis during<br> sexual intercourse and carries sperm to the uterus and fallopian tubes. It also serves as the birth canal by stretching to<br> allow delivery of the fetus during childbirth. During menstruation, the menstrual flow exits the body via the vagina.</p>
            <h3>Vulva</h3>
            <p>The <a href="https://teachmeanatomy.info/pelvis/female-reproductive-tract/the-vulva/">vulva</a>  is the collective name for the external female genitalia located in the pubic region of the body. The vulva<br> surrounds the external ends of the urethral opening and the vagina and includes the mons pubis, labia majora, labia<br> minora, and clitoris. The mons pubis, or pubic mound, is a raised layer of adipose tissue between the skin and the pubic<br> bone that provides cushioning to the vulva. </p>
